# About POI Mark 2

Show off Places of Interest (POI) by importing them from OpenStreetMap and styling them with HTML5 Canvas and CSS3.
Each Place will be connected to a record on a NoSQL database: either MongoDB (through MongoLab) or CouchDB (through DataCouch).

Here are some features available now:
<ul>
<li>Build on top of the best OpenStreetMap, Stamen, and MapBox map tiles</li>
<li>Explore and interact with the Leaflet.js maps API</li>
<li>Make buildings pop out of the map with a 3D effect</li>
<li>Choose textures for parks, farms, forests, and other areas</li>
<li>Click and drag points to edit shapes imported from OpenStreetMap</li>
<li>Code new visualizations, such as <a href='http://poimark2.herokuapp.com/kansas?id=514dc6a78e5a460200000001'>crayon</a>, to apply to any map geometry.</li>
</ul>

Different directions this could take:
<ul>
<li>Visualizations based on OSM tags or other geodata</li>
<li>GitHub of procedural buildings, markers, etc</li>
<li>Realtime map layer using node: https://github.com/whichlight/nodejs-leaflet-eventstreams</li>
<li>Feeding geodata into MongoDB, with custom queries to search / change appearance of data</li>
<li>Collaboration using node</li>
<li>Data check-out</li>
</ul>

## Theory

### Old Model
The author uses the wealth of OpenStreetMap data as a background, then builds their own layer from scratch.
Participation by users is difficult to build into the system.

### New Model
The author imports buildings, parks, and other places from OpenStreetMap to populate their map.
Users are invited to interact with the data available at each Place.
Authors can match their own set of points to OpenStreetMap and DataCouch datasets.

# About NoSQL:
<p>Most databases are like a giant Excel sheet - each row has a set number of columns which can be used to compare it with other rows.</p>
<p>NoSQL is more like a city - each building can have a completely different shape and function. A restaurant can be classified by the types of food they serve, a school can have information about number of students, and both can be classified by number of employees.
Our NoSQL database, MongoDB, makes it possible to search for objects closest to a point or within a set area (geospatial searching)</p>


# About Poang Framework

## Poang - A sample node.js/MongoDB app for Heroku/MongoLab

Poang ([github](https://github.com/BeyondFog/Poang)) is a Node.js/MongoDB app built using the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework. Poang uses [Everyauth](http://everyauth.com/) for local authentication, [Mongoose-Auth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth) to connect Everyauth to MongoDB (and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as the ODM) for account persistence, and [Connect-Mongo](https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo) as a session store. Most of the code in app.js was generated by Express and all of the code in auth.js after the Comment schema is straight from the Mongoose-Auth docs.

For testing, Poang uses the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test framework, [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) for assertions, [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) for mocks & stubs, and [Zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/) for lightweight integration testing.

For more details, please see Steve's [blog post](http://blog.beyondfog.com/?p=222) that walks through the various tests in Poang.

## Local Installation
 
1) Do a git clone:

    git clone git@github.com:mapmeld/POI-Mark2.git
    
2) cd into the project directory and then install the necessary node modules:

    npm install -d

3) start up MongoDB if it's not already running:
  
    mongod --noprealloc --nojournal
    
4) start the node process:

    node app.js

## Deploy to Heroku

    heroku create APP_NAME -s cedar
    git push heroku master

After you have created a new app on Heroku and pushed the code via git, you will need to use the Heroku Toolbelt from your command line to add the free MongoLab starter addon:

    heroku addons:add mongolab:starter --app [your_app_name]

You will need to install <a href="https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/node-canvas-heroku">node-canvas-heroku</a> (included in node_modules directory) to render images in canvas on the server side. These steps install cairo (a dependency of node-canvas) before running npm

    heroku config:add LD_PRELOAD='/app/node_modules/canvas/cairo/libcairo.so /app/node_modules/canvas/cairo/lib/libpixman-1.so.0 /app/node_modules/canvas/cairo/lib/libfreetype.so.6'
    heroku config:add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/app/node_modules/canvas/cairo
